Status: ✅ PASSED
Date: 2026-02-03

SUMMARY:
--------
Successfully verified that the Quick Actions bar on the dashboard is fully
responsive and accessible on mobile devices at 375px width (standard mobile
viewport).

VERIFICATION STEPS COMPLETED:
----------------------------
✅ Step 1: View dashboard at 375px width
   - Set browser viewport to 375x812 (iPhone X dimensions)
   - Dashboard renders correctly at mobile width
   - Quick Actions section visible and accessible

✅ Step 2: Verify quick actions bar is visible
   - Section with data-testid="quick-actions-section" is visible
   - Container height: 268px
   - All buttons visible within viewport
   - Section renders with proper styling (bg-[#1a1a1a], border, rounded-2xl)

✅ Step 3: Verify buttons are large enough to tap (44px min)
   - Button 1 (Log from Plan): 54px height × 195px width ✓
   - Button 2 (Search Food): 54px height × 181px width ✓
   - Button 3 (Quick Add): 54px height × 158px width ✓
   - All buttons exceed 44px minimum tap target requirement
   - All buttons exceed 44px minimum width requirement
   - Button padding: py-3 (12px top/bottom) + px-5 (20px left/right)

✅ Step 4: Verify all 3 actions accessible
   - "Log from Plan" button clickable → navigates to /tracking?mode=plan ✓
   - "Search Food" button clickable → navigates to /tracking?mode=search ✓
   - "Quick Add" button clickable → navigates to /tracking?mode=quick ✓
   - All buttons have proper aria-labels for accessibility ✓
   - All buttons are keyboard accessible ✓

✅ Step 5: Verify buttons don't overlap or get cut off
   - Container uses flex layout with flex-wrap ✓
   - Buttons wrap vertically on mobile (stack vertically) ✓
   - 12px gap between buttons (gap-3) ✓
   - No overlapping detected:
     * Button 1: top=1719, bottom=1773
     * Button 2: top=1785, bottom=1839 (12px gap)
     * Button 3: top=1851, bottom=1905 (12px gap)
   - All buttons contained within section bounds ✓
